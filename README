APPROXIMATE DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING (ADP) SOL PYTHON STARTING MODEL

This folder contains all the necessary files for the starting model of the ADP assignment.
To open and edit the files you need a Python IDE, like Spyder or PyCharm. 
You need Python 3.7 or higher to run the code.
There are already some procedures and functions stated which can help you with this assignment. See the comments in the code for a full explanation.
Please note that the already defined procedures may need to be adapted, so it is certainly necessary to understand the code before you start programming yourself.
The code for both Part A and Part B is only an example implementation, there are many different ways to model optimal learning policies and
Approximate Dynamic Programming. Even the ADP approach in Mes & Rivera (2017) allows for many modeling choices.

The Python project is divided into two separate files:
 *MainUnit
 *PartAAndB

MainUnit:
This is the file in which all controls are stated. You control parameters and run experiments from this file.

PartAAndB:
In this file, the starting model for Part A (Approximate Dynamic Programming) and Part B (ADP with Value Function Approximation) is stated.
It is your task to finish the code for the following procedures:
 *FiniteADP
 *InfiniteADP
 *DoublePassFiniteADP

Inside these three procedures, there is a part reserved for Part B of the assignment (Value Function Approximation) which concerns generalization across states.
This is indicated in the comments.
